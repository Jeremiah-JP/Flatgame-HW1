My intention for this game was to create something with rats, as I had been thinking about how you can buy a pet rat from Petco. I then remembered that there are subway rats in NYC and decided to make a game with them in a subway. 
I just wanted to make the game an exploration-type of game and make it seem like its a daily routine of a rat in a subway and what they would normally see when they go in there. I learned how to add audio on collisions and how to use 2d lights. I did realize, though, spamming my game with 2d lights makes the frame rate pretty bad lol so I'll probably learn a more efficcient way for doing so in the future.
But I'm proud that I learned one new thing to do in Unity, considering I'm fairly new to it, so learning anything new I'll take as a win and be proud of.
