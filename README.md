My intentions for this game was to do something with rats because I was thinking about how you can buy a pet rat from petco. I then remembered there are subway rats here in NYC and decided to go with a rat game in a subway
I just wanted to make the game an exploration type of game and make it seem like its a daily routine of a rat in a subway and what they would normally see when they go in there. 
I learned how to add audios on collisions and how to use 2d lights. I did realize though, spamming my game with 2d lights makes the frame rate pretty bad lol so I'll probably learn a more efficcient way for doing so in the future.
But I'm proud that I learned one new thing to do in unity considering Im fairly new to it, so learning anything new I'll take as a win and be proud of.
