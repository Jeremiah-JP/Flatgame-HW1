# Flatgame-HW1 Devlog
My intentions for this game was to do something with rats because I was thinking about how you can buy a pet rat from petco. I then remembered there are subway rats here in NYC and decided to go with a rat game in a subway
I just wanted to make the game an exploration type of game and make it seem like its a daily routing of a rat in a subway and what they would normally see when they go in there.
